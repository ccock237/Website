			Clayton Cockrell was born in South Carolina 19 years ago. He has to this day lived in South Carolina.
			He was homeschooled throughout his schooling years, and, upon high school graduation, he went to 
			Tri-County Technical College in South Carolina. It had always been an interest of his to program, but 
			he did not know what kind of programming he wanted to do. He played with Python and HTML programming, 
			but wanted something more interactive and gamelike. Wanting to know more, he pursued an Associates 
			Degree in Computer Technology at Tri-County Technical College in 2016. During this time, he learned 
			much about computers. Graduating at the end of 2017, he acquired many skills in Windows and Linux 
			operating systems, Web Development (frontend and backend), the Software Development Cycle, Networking 
			(software and hardware), C/C++ programming, and Java programming. He also was given the tools to learn 
			about Python and other programming languages to bring himself to the point he is now.
